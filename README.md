# Frontend
The client side of my app uses React JS for UI creation, CSS for styling and React-Router-Dom for routing.
I am also using Material-UI library to fetch some icons and prebuilt components.

#Backend
Certainly! Here's your description presented in a more organized manner:

**Building a Server-Side Application with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB**

I am in the process of developing a server-side application, and I have chosen to use a combination of cutting-edge technologies to ensure security, efficiency, and functionality. My stack includes:

1. **Node.js**: I'm leveraging the power of Node.js, a powerful runtime environment, to build the backend of my application. Node.js enables me to write server-side code using JavaScript, making development more streamlined and consistent.

2. **Express.js**: To create robust APIs and manage routing effectively, I've integrated Express.js into my stack. Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable APIs.

3. **MongoDB**: For the database layer of my application, I've opted for MongoDB. This NoSQL database offers flexibility and scalability, making it a suitable choice for various types of applications. I can easily manage data in a JSON-like format without the need for rigid schemas.

4. **Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: To ensure secure authentication, I'm implementing JSON Web Tokens. JWTs allow me to securely transmit user information between the client and server without compromising sensitive data. This technology is essential for creating a secure and seamless user experience.

5. **Bcrypt.js**: In the realm of security, I'm using bcrypt.js to hash passwords before storing them in the database. This ensures that user passwords are not stored in plain text, providing an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access.

By combining these technologies, I'm developing a powerful and secure server-side application that will offer seamless user experiences while maintaining the highest standards of security. This stack enables me to efficiently handle user authentication and manage data in a secure and scalable manner.

# Progress
The client side application is complete will start working on the backend
